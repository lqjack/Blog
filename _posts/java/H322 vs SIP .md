SIP

H.323

"New World" - a relative of Internet protocols -

simple, open and horizontal

"Old World" - complex, deterministic and vertical

IETF

ITU

Carrier-class solution addressing the wide area

Borne of the LAN - focusing on enterprise conferencing priorities

A simple toolkit upon which smart clients and applications can be built.

It re-uses Net elements (URLs, MIME and DNS)

H.323 specifies everything including the codec for the media and how you carry the packets in RTP

Leaves issues of reliability to underlying network

Assumes fallibility of network - an unnecessary overhead

SIP messages are formatted as text.

H.323 messages are ASN.1 binary encoded, adding complexity

Minimal delay - simplified signalling scheme makes it faster

Possibilities of delay (up to 7 or 8 seconds!)

Slim and Pragmatic

The suite is too cumbersome to deploy easily

Seamless interaction with other media -

services are only limited by the developers imagination

Services are nailed-down and constricted

Many vendors developing products

The majority of legacy existing IP telephony products rely on the H.323 suite
